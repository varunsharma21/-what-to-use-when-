BINARY SEARCH
- Array is sorted.
- Array is mountain/bitonic array.
- Array containing several bitonic parts.
- Can also be applied in 2d array and MOST of the problems could be solved in O(n + logm), TRICK - try to cut the search space.

THINGS TO LOOK SERIOUSLY IN BINARY SEARCH
- Learn where to use while(start <= end) and while(start < end) conditions. Tip dry running code will help.

TO ADD THINGS
1. links to leetcode medium problems.
2. 2 examples of 2D matrix binary search.
3. Anything I will learn in future.
